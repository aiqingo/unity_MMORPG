Installing HyperText
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply import the package and everything should "just work." Watch my video
tutorial online at http://youtu.be/K7yPDQcfQpU to get an overview of all of the
high-level features and usage of the HyperText tool.

If you wish to publish packages that depend on this one, you can do so with the
IS_CANDLELIGHT_HYPERTEXT_AVAILABLE symbol.

If you experience any problems, please open the Unity preferences menu, navigate
to the Candlelight section on the left, select the HyperText tab, and use the
buttons at the bottom to report a bug or visit the support forum.
